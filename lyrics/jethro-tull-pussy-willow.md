### Pussy Willow
#### Jethro Tull

In the half-tone light of a young morning  
she sighs and shifts on the pillow  
And across her face dancing, the first shadows fly  
to kiss the Pussy Willow

In her fairy-tale world she's a lost soul singing  
in a sad voice nobody hears  
She waits in her castle of make-believing  
for her white knight to appear

Pussy Willow, down fur-lined avenue  
brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes  
Runs for the train, see, eight o'clock's coming  
cutting dreams down to size again

Pussy Willow, down fur-lined avenue  
brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes  
Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming  
cutting dreams down to size again

She longs for the East and a pale dress flowing  
an apartment in old Mayfair  
Or to fish the Spey, spinning the first run of Spring  
or to die for a cause somewhere

Pussy Willow, down fur-lined avenue  
brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes  
Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming  
cutting dreams down to size again

Pussy Willow
