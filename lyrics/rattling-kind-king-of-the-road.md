### King of the Road
#### The Rattling Kind

[chorus]
When you're hooring down the road
At ninety mile an hour on the back of a sulky racer
With the wind in your hair and the reigns in your hands
And the horse is in your favour
You're King of the Road

Crack of dawn on a Sunday morn
And the convoy's in full flow
Pajero jeeps, cars and vans
With the horse box on the tow
Heading out to the edge of town
There's a big race going down
First nose to pass the two mile mark
Is crowned the King of the Road

Remember Chip'n'pin and the Indian
In the Class A free leg race
When the Chip took the gold on the Mullingar Road
Well it wasn't the Indian's day
But the Indian has blood to win
He was bred by the big Gang Joyce
For he's sired the foals worth their weight in gold
Taking home now many a race

[chorus]

Now there ain't no flies on the Big Noise
If there are, they're paying the rent
When the Big Noise ran with I'm the Man
And the record he did break
3:57 down the Dualer, flat out on a two mile stretch
Never be the sore loser, cough up now and pay your bets

[chorus]

Fourteen spins and fourteen wins
From the Streamline Sapphire mare
With a record broke on the Ringsend Road
One morning in the Derry air
Now Thomas Clark has left his mark
With a fine bred coloured cob
And the Love/Hate, Big Noise, Sapphire Crew all part of the Indian's mob

[chorus twice]
