### A Fairytale
#### Christy Moore

A young man fell in love with truth  
And searching the wide world for her  
He found her in a small house  
In a clearing in the forest  
She was old and she was stooped  
He pledged himself to her  
To chop wood and to carry water  
To collect the root the stem the leaf  
And the flowering top and seed  
Of every plant she’d need  
To do her work

Years went by until one day  
The young man woke up longing for a child  
He went to the old woman  
And he asked to be released from his oath to her  
That he might return to the world  
“Certainly”, she said,  
“On one condition”  
“You must tell them that I’m young and beautiful.”  
“You must tell them that I’m young and beautiful.”
