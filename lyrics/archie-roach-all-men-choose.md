#### All Men Choose the Path They Walk

Some men are prone to misadventure  
Questions of guilt aren't always clear  
Some men run from a fate they can't avoid  
All men choose the path they walk  

Some can't be faulted for their reason  
Failing to justly intervene  
Some men hide from the memories that haunt  
All men choose the path they walk  

Some men see everything through duty  
Cast off responsibility  
Some regret that their courage sometimes fails  
All men choose the path they walk  

Some men have attitude that's righteous  
Care not about the consequence  
Some men fight with the violence inside  
All men choose the path they walk  

Some men have reached their destination  
Finding their own serenity  
Some men lead others till they recognise  
That all men choose the path they walk
