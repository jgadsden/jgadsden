### All around The Town
#### The Rattling Kind

We all know someone  
Who's effected by the pain  
Guns and drugs and violence  
They all do much the same  

Its like a viral infection  
It keeps on spreading  
Travelling all over the town  

Open your eyes  
Take a look around  
Tell me what you find  

I find it hard to read the paper  
Nightmares becoming real  
Young people are dying  
Their parents are crying  
Grandparents don't understand  

All around the town  
A shot gets fired and another man down  

All around the town  
A knife gets pulled and another child down  

All around the town  
Parents weep in their tears they drown  

All around the town  
Young kiddies lowered into the ground  

They stand alone in this and clueless  
Fighting a fight they canâ€™t possibly win  
Disorganised and unequipped  
Ill prepared with no leadership  

Arrive at the scene  
As the bodies are moved  
Shaking their heads  
Standing there like fools  
That's half the problem  
They are victims too  

We have armed police  
Standing on our streets  
Our people can't comprehend  
Is it reassurance or self assurance?  
What choices do we have today?  

Yet the people in power  
Won't open their eyes  
To see what they have done  
With the marginilisation  
Cultural deprivation  
Prevention is better than cure  

Building concrete cascades  
Of urban jungles  
You gave us no other way  

All around the town  
A shot gets fired and another man down  

All around the town  
A knife gets pulled and another child down  

All around the town  
And the parents weep in their tears they drown  

All around the town  
Young kiddies lowered into the ground  

The devil makes work for idle hands  
People wonder why he's so many followers  
Abandoned generation, destroying the nation  
I can barely watch as it burns  

And as the virus gets closer to your door  
You admit your neighbour your son no more  

You can feel it like a mist as it creeps the streets  
Sirens blaring in your heart it beats  
Bullets whizz through the night-time  
I hope my child comes home tonight  

[chorus]  
All around the town  
A shot gets fired and another man down  

All around the town  
A knife gets pulled and another child down  

All around the town  
The parents weep in their tears they drown  

All around the town  
Young kiddies lowered into the ground  

[repeat chorus]
