### Pink Triangle
#### Christy Moore
(after Pastor Niemuller â€“ dedicated to the memory of Phyllis McGhee)

Black triangle, pink triangle  
Green triangle, red triangle  
Blue triangle, lilac triangle  
And they wore the yellow triangle  
And they wore the yellow triangle

When first they came for the criminals  
I did not speak  
Then they began to take the Jews  
When they fetched the people  
Who were members of trade unions  
I did not speak

They took the Bible students  
Rounded up the homosexuals  
Then they gathered up the immigrants and the gypsies  
I did not speak  
I did not speak

Eventually they came for me  
There was no one left to speak

Black triangle, pink triangle  
Green triangle, red triangle  
Blue triangle, lilac triangle  
And they wore the yellow triangle

And they wore the lilac triangle  
And they wore the pink triangle  
And they wore the blue triangle  
And we wore the silent triangle  
We did not speak
