### I Will Go
#### The Corries

I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  

When the King's son came along  
He called us all together  
Saying, brave highland men  
Will you fight for my father  
I will go, I will go  

I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  

I've a buckle on my belt  
A sword in my scabbard  
A red coat on my back  
And a shilling in my pocket  
I will go I will go  

I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  

When they put us all on board  
The lassies were singing  
But the tears came to their eyes  
When the bells started ringing  
I will go, I will go  

When we landed on the shore  
And saw the foreign heather  
We knew that some would fall  
And would stay there forever  
I will go, I will go  

I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  

When we came back to the glen  
The winter was turning  
Our goods lay in the snow  
And our houses were burning  
I will go, I will go  

I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go  
When the fighting is over  
To the land of McLeod  
That I left to be a soldier  
I will go, I will go
